  "metaData": "Arrays are one of the fundamental data structures in JavaScript. They allow you to store multiple values in a single variable. You can access and manipulate the elements of an array using various methods and properties. JavaScript arrays can hold different types of data, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays."
